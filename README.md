Common EUHM 71ICU Procedures Reference App

The Common EUHM 71ICU Procedures Reference App is a sample application that provides information regarding the most common or most performed procedures by nurses at 71ICU in Emory University Hospital Midtown. 

It provides two options to navigate to the procedure's information:
1. Using the dropdown menu to show the procedure's steps, indications, and contraindications. 
2. Clicking the "Show all procedures" button will show a list of all procedures.
    a. After clicking the button, the user has the option to double-click on a procedure, and it will show the user more useful information, such as steps, indications, and contraindications of the procedure. 

Here is a preview of how to navigate through the app:
